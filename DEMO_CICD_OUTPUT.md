   🔒 Add this to GitHub Secrets as AZURE_CREDENTIALS:
   =================================================
   {
     "clientId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
     "clientSecret": "your-secret-here",
     "subscriptionId": "87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321", 
     "tenantId": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
   }
   =================================================

   📋 GitHub Secrets Configuration
   ===============================
   Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
   (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions)

   Secret Name: AZURE_CREDENTIALS
   Value: [Service Principal JSON from above]

   Secret Name: AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY
   Value: aidemotestacr123

   Secret Name: AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP 
   Value: rg-ai-demo-test

   Secret Name: AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME
   Value: app-ai-demo-test

5️⃣  Final setup steps...

🎉 SETUP COMPLETE! Here's what was created:

✅ Azure Container Registry - for storing your app images
✅ Azure App Service - for hosting your containerized app
✅ GitHub Actions service principal - for automated deployments
✅ CI/CD pipeline configuration - builds & deploys on every commit

🔑 IMPORTANT - Configure GitHub Secrets:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Add the secrets shown above (from the service principal output)

🚀 Next Steps:
1. Configure GitHub secrets (required for automation)
2. Push your code: git push origin main
3. Watch the magic happen in GitHub Actions tab!

🧪 Would you like to test the CI/CD pipeline now? (Y/n): Y

## What This Automated Setup Achieves

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Created
- **Azure Container Registry** - Stores your containerized app images
- **Azure App Service** - Hosts your Streamlit application
- **Azure OpenAI Service** - GPT-4o model for image analysis
- **Managed Identity** - Secure authentication without API keys
- **Application Insights** - Monitoring and logging

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Configured
- **Triggers**: Automatic builds on commits to main/develop branches
- **Build Process**: Container image creation with security scanning
- **Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment to Azure App Service
- **Testing**: Automated health checks and integration tests
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of old container images

### 🔐 Security Features
- Service principal with minimal required permissions
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Secure credential storage in GitHub secrets
- Managed identity for Azure service authentication
- HTTPS-only traffic encryption

### 📊 Monitoring & Management
- GitHub Actions dashboard for build/deploy monitoring
- Azure Application Insights for application telemetry
- Automated health checks after each deployment
- Integration tests to verify functionality

## After Setup - Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make code changes
echo "# Updated feature" >> streamlit_app.py

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added new feature"
git push origin main

# 3. Automatic CI/CD triggers:
#    ✅ Container build
#    ✅ Security scan  
#    ✅ Push to ACR
#    ✅ Deploy to App Service
